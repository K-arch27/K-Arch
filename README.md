# K-Arch
## My own Config for ArchIso Installing Arch with Btrfs

### This Config has been modified to allow users to easily install Arch Linux with a Btrfs file system as the root file system, and with a pre-configured subvolume ready for use with the Snapper tool.


### -- Build yourself --

1. Install archiso
2. Use mkarchiso to build inside this directory

### -- Features --



- Live Environement Booting OpenBox


- Gparted Included for ease of partitionning


- Firefox Included so the user can make some search on the different options


- Auto-Installer that prompt the User with some choice about the system they want (Keymap, Locale, Username, Hostname, Kernel, Shell, Graphical Environement, Choice of Repo, Aur Helper, etc..)  variation of my script found there : https://github.com/K-arch27/archscript
